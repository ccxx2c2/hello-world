# hello-world

My first repository on GitHub.

Just knowing little of CodeWorld.

I have made some child-class 'toys'(maybe the word 'wheels' is correct),

some of which are made of C,C++,html+php+css,js...

Perhaps it's 'not knowing the key of ways to learn new things ' that limits me.

Oh,come on.
